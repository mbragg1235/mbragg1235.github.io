    	<h2> My Top Three Adventures </h2>
    	<h3> The Scottish Castle Trail </h3>

    	<p> The first adventure on my list is a magical driving tour route that spans a total three hundred eleven miles! </p>

    	<p> <IMG SRC="castletrail.jpg" width="700" height="500" alt="Scottish Castle Trail"> </p>

    	<p> This Scottish castle trail contains nineteen different castles ranging from the beautiful Dunnottar Castle sitting on a hill next to the water to the fairytale like Craigievar Castle, decorated with turrets and gargoyles. </p> 

    	<h3> The Borders Abbeys of Scotland </h3>
    	<p> The next adventure on my itinerary for Scotland is a visit to one of their more historical sites. </p>
    	<p><IMG SRC="borderabbeys.jpg" width="700" height="500" alt="The Border Abbeys of Scotland"> </p>
    	<p> The Border Abbeys of Scotland were once home to the monks between the 12th and 16th centuries. They now connect via a long-distance footpath with four different ancient buildings along the way. Of course, since the trail spans a whopping 68 miles, it will be a multiple day hike. </p>
    	<h3> Ediburgh: Scotland's Capital </h3> 
    	<p> The final destination on my list of the greats of Scotland is arguably its most historically rich, most beautiful, and most popular city: Edinburgh</p>
    	<p><IMG SRC="edinburg.jpg" width="700" height="500" alt="Ediburgh"> </p>
    	<p> Not only is this place the most beautiful city in Scotland, it also has the most famous castle in Scotland: Ediburgh castle. Old Town, Edinburgh's oldest district still has many Reformation-era buildings. Along with those the district has a vault that lies beneath, you can take a tour to explore it. </p>
