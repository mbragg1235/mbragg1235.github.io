        <p> Hello, my name is Maggie Bragg. I am a student at the University of Maine and currently, one of my dreams is to someday travel the world. This is a website of the top destinations on my travel bucket list. I hope you enjoy them as much as I do! </p>

        <p> My number one travel destination is Scotland. I love the architecture and the rich European History. If you want to learn more about the specific places, I want to visit click <A HREF="scotland.html"> here</A>.  </p>

        <p> The second destination on my list is Greece. The buildings are beautiful, as are the beaches. Don't even get me started on the History. If you want to learn more about all the beautiful buildings and beaches, click <A HREF="greece.html"> here </A>. </p>

        <p> My third travel destination is somewhere where, you guessed it: there is a terrific history. I've always dreamed of walking the French Quarter in New Orleans, Louisiana. If you want to explore the French Quarter alongside me click <A HREF="neworleans.html"> here</A>. </p>

        <p> The final destination on my list is the Iberian Peninsula (also known as Spain and Portugal). The mountains are not the only thing beautiful about this stretch of Europe, the palaces built by the ancient Muslims after their invasion of Spain are nothing short of magical. If you want to see the beauty of the peninsula click <A HREF="iberianpeninsula.html"> here</A>. </p> </center>
