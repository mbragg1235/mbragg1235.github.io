        <h1> Greece </h1>
        <h2> My Top Three Destinations </h2>
        <h3> Cruise of the Greek Islands </h3>
        <p> One of the adventures on my travel bucket list is to take a cruise around the islands of Greece. </p>

        <p> Greece is a beautiful place but one of the elements I find most exciting is the architeture all over the country. Some of the richest buildings can be found on the islands of Santorini, Paros, and Crete. </p>
        <h3> The Greek Beaches </h3>
        <p> One of the other beauties of the country is the amazing beaches that it contains. </p>

        <p> The island of Crete is known for its amazing beaches. One of my dreams is to feel the sand under my feet and the water of the Mediterranean on my skin. </p>
        <h3> The Ancient City of Athens </h3>
        <p> The final destination on my dream tour of Greece is the ancient city of Athens. </p>
        <p> <IMG SRC="athens.jpg" width="700" height="500" alt="City of Athens"> </p>
        <p> Athens is the capital and largest city of Greece. In addition to that it is also one of the world's oldest cities. I know, amazing for a history buff, right? It is known as the cradle of Western civilization and it is full of ancient monuments and art. The perfect place for me to see all the architecture of the ancient world! </p>
